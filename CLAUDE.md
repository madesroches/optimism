# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Optimism** is a Pac-Man-inspired Rust game loosely based on Voltaire's *Candide, ou l'Optimisme*. Its primary purpose is to serve as an example/tutorial demonstrating how to use [Micromegas](https://github.com/madesroches/micromegas) (a telemetry/analytics framework) in the context of a Rust game.

## Project Status

Early concept phase. The game design document is in `concept/OPTIMISM.md`. No code has been written yet.

## Architecture (Planned)

- **Language**: Rust
- **Telemetry**: Micromegas integration as the tutorial focus
- **Genre**: Pac-Man-style arcade game with narrative elements
