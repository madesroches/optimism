# Pull Request — Lint, Test, and Submit

Create a pull request for the current branch after running lints/tests and finalizing any associated plan file.

## Process

### Phase 1: Gather Context

1. `git branch --show-current` — identify the current branch
2. `git log --oneline main..HEAD` — list commits in this branch
3. `git diff main..HEAD --stat` — file summary to determine which areas changed
4. Identify the originating GitHub issue:
   - First, check the plan file found in `tasks/` (see Phase 3) — plans typically have `**GitHub Issue**: #123` or a URL on line 3
   - If no plan file, check commit messages and branch name for issue references (e.g., `#123`, `issue-123`)
   - If not found there, search GitHub issues: `gh issue list --search "<branch name or feature keywords>" --state open` and `--state closed`
   - If still no match, ask the user with AskUserQuestion

### Phase 2: Run Lints and Tests

Run checks in parallel using the Task tool with `subagent_type: "Bash"`:

```
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

If any check fails, report the failures and stop. Do NOT create the PR. Tell the user what needs to be fixed.

### Phase 3: Plan File Management

The plan file should already be part of the branch's diff (moved/updated and committed). Verify this:

1. Check `git diff main..HEAD --stat` for plan file changes in `tasks/`
2. If a plan file was moved to `tasks/completed/`, good — note it for the PR description
3. If a plan file exists in `tasks/` (not `completed/`) and relates to this branch:
   - Read it and check if all implementation steps are completed based on the commits
   - If incomplete, ask the user: "The plan still has incomplete steps. Should I update it and commit before creating the PR?"
   - If done, move it to `tasks/completed/`, commit the move, then proceed
4. If no plan file is found, that's fine — proceed without one

### Phase 4: Update Changelog

Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes from this branch.

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` to understand the current format and the `## Unreleased` section
2. Review the commits (`git log --oneline main..HEAD`) and the PR summary you're about to write
3. Add concise bullet points under the `## Unreleased` section:
   - Group under an existing bold category header or create a new one if nothing fits
   - Each bullet should be a short description with the issue number in parentheses, e.g., `* Add zoom buttons to chart (#123)`
   - Match the style of existing entries — start with a verb (Add, Fix, Refactor, Update, Remove), include issue/PR number
   - Don't duplicate entries that are already in the changelog
4. Commit the changelog update: `git commit -m "Update changelog"`

### Phase 5: Create the Pull Request

1. Check if the branch has been pushed to the remote:
   - `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}` to check tracking
   - If not pushed or behind, push with `git push -u origin <branch>`

2. Build the PR description:
   - Title: concise summary of the changes (under 70 characters)
   - Body must include:
     - `## Summary` — bullet points describing what changed and why
     - `Closes #<issue>` or `Fixes #<issue>` to link the originating issue (use `Closes` for features, `Fixes` for bugs)
     - `## Test plan` — how to verify the changes work
     - If a plan file was moved to completed, mention it: "Design plan: `tasks/completed/<file>`"

3. Create the PR:
```
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<bullets>

<Closes/Fixes #issue>

## Test plan
<verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

4. Output the PR URL when done.

## Guidelines

- Never force-push or amend commits during this process
- If lints fail with auto-fixable issues (e.g., formatting), ask the user if they want you to fix and commit before retrying
- The issue link is important — always try to find it before falling back to asking
- Keep the PR title short and descriptive — put details in the body
- Match the existing PR style in the repository
